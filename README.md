### This project will demonstrate how to:
- Create a UI for controlling Tello Drone
- Handle drone using virtual controls
- Process H.264 (AVC) encoded video from Tello and display it on app
- Perform near real-time object detection from Tello video frame

### Things to fix:
- 0.    Video feed keeps getting stuck during flight (Temporary fix: turn the video switch at the top left of the screen on and off again). A permanent fix is needed.
- 1.	I could not figure out a way to toggle between and SurfaceView and BitMap displaying for simply viewing video frames vs performing object detection
- 2.	Some of the calculations like drone acceleration etc. needs more attention and correction.
- 3.	Improve the efficiency of the code and simplify it.
- 4.	Closing datagram sockets while not in use or going back to the main page is not working.
- 5.    Capture image and record video buttons does not work at this point, but I will be adding these features soon.

### How to install this application?

Open android studio> open demoApplication project > Build > run app (preferably connecting your phone)

### Things to keep in mind:

- While testing on Pixel 4 (Android 12) I faced issues associated with UDP connection. After connecting to Tello's wifi, under internet> wifi> TelloNetworkName> Privacy, there are two options. 1) Use randomized MAC (default) 2) Use device MAC. After connecting to Tello netwok, swith between these options before using the app.
- The above step will disconnect from the wifi and reconnect again, only then will this app work on Pixel 4 (Android 12), this could be only a problem on my device Pixel 4 in general (I don't know it yet)
- There could be several bugs, things could be done in an easier and efficient way, possibly. Please report bugs and issues.
- If you face any issues during development or installation, please raise an issue in my GitHub page for this project

 More importantly, I am excited to see cool application of this project. And finally, if you liked this project and find it interesting, please :star: the project so that it can reach more people. Thank you and hope you have some fun with this!.
